<h1> What Is Code? </h1>
<p> Code is multiple letters/numbers that control what happens in games/websites/technology. Another explanation of what code is a set of rules that allow a machine/website/game to function.  Code consists of many different languages, The basic ones include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. </p>
<p> The 4 coding languages I had mentioned are only a small fraction of the amount of languages there are. Not all code is used for the same for example, Java is used for distributing programs among people over a network(s) and/or server(s), VB (Visual Basic) is used to edit already written bits of code to create/edit something in a different ways. </p>
<h1> What is HTML? </h1>
<p> HTML could be called the skeleton of a website, giving the website structure, HTML is used mostly to create paragraphs, Headings, Images and links to websites. HTML is the code I'm using at the moment to create this project. If you want to get a quick look at a websites HTML code, it's as simple as right clicking on a website and open up the properties tab and seeing different parts of the code. </p>
