<h1> What Is Code? </h1>
<p> Code is multiple letters/numbers that control what happens in games/websites/technology. Another explanation of what code is a set of rules that allow a machine/website/game to function.  Code consists of many different languages, The basic ones include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. </p>
<p> The 4 coding languages I had mentioned are only a small fraction of the amount of languages there are. Not all code is used for the same for example, Java is used for distributing programs among people over a network(s) and/or server(s), VB (Visual Basic) is used to edit already written bits of code to create/edit something in a different ways. </p>
