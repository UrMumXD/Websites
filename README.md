<p style="font-size: 2px"> This is the start of my presentation on Coding, Please be aware that there may be mitsakes in this project.</p>
<p> Down below are the parts of this presentation I will be talking about. </p>
<ul>
<li> What is code?
<li> What is Python
<li> What is HTML?
<li> What is CSS?
<li> Why is code important?
</ul>
<!--DON'T FORGET TO COMMENT STUFF PLEASE -->
<h1> What Is Code? </h1>
<p> Code is multiple letters/numbers that control what happens in games/websites/technology. Another explanation of what code is a set of rules that allow a machine/website/game to function.  Code consists of many different languages, The basic ones include HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. </p>
<p> The 4 coding languages I had mentioned are only a small fraction of the amount of languages there are. Not all code is used for the same for example, Java is used for distributing progra/>ms among people over a network(s) and/or server(s), VB (Visual Basic) is used to edit already written bits of code to create/edit something in a different ways. </p>
<p> Soon during this presentation, I will show the code I used during the creation of this and the amount of code really isn't that much.

<h1> What is Python </h1>

<p> Python is farely new to me but it is a really useful Language to learn. Python can be used for multiple different things including Game/App Creation and Website building. before I tell you useful information I need to quickly nerd out for a second, python IS AWESOME, THE COOLEST THING ABOUT PYTHON IS THAT YOU GET A CONSOLE CLOSE TO WHERE YOU CODE AND IT SHOWS ALL THE ERRORS YOU'VE MADE, IT IS AWESOME.
alright now that thats dones lets move onto the helpful information.
A part of python is using it as a calculator that uses letters and store information that you can use later on with the code. 


<h1> What is HTML? </h1>
<img src= "https://specs.adfox.ru/help/images/swiffiFlashHTML.png"/>
<p> HTML could be called the skeleton of a website, giving the website structure, HTML is used mostly to create paragraphs, Headings, Images and links to websites. HTML is the code I'm using at the moment to create this project. If you want to get a quick look at a websites HTML code, it's as simple as right clicking on a website and open up the properties tab and seeing different parts of the code. </p>

<p> HTML may seem scary at first but if you push yourself to learn about it more, It becomes one of the more easy things in the world, and you can say you know code to sound very smart. Above this paragraph is a picture and you might be thinking about how much code would go into putting a simple picture into the website but its very easy, The HTML needed to place an image is "(Less than Sign) img src=(Enter Image URL Here)/ (Greater Than sign)" PS. I had to use the text "(Great than sign)" instead of the < & >  Because it would register it as code. but the HTML most people use (like myself) is for writing information on a website, The basic code is for that is (less than) p (greater than) THEN at the end of the paragraph, you type (less than) p/ (greater than) Then you've finished, The "P" Stands for Paragraph by the way. </p>
<p> There are multiples commands for HTML, just to name a few: em, Strong, table, ol, ul, and the h commands.
The h commands create letters/sentences that are a certain size, 1 being the biggest and 5 being the smallest. Below are the sizes and the commands. </p>
<h1> h1 </h1> <h2> h2 </h2> <h3> h3 </h3> <h4> h4 </h4> <h5> h5 </h5>
<p> The em command selects word/words of your choosing and gives them the <em> italic font </em>.
The strong command gives the selected word/words a <strong> bold font </strong>.
The table command creates a table (Not like dining tables), this command is a more advanced command and can be very difficult to use properly. <table>
<tr>
<td> test </td>
<td> Test </td>
</tr>
</table>
The ol and ul commands are almost the same, the only diffirence is that one uses numbers and the other uses dots. ol stands for ordered lists and ul stands for unordered lists.
<ol>
<li> Test (ol)
</ol>
<ul> 
<li> Test (ul)
</ul>
<p> There is also two very useful commands which are typed as img and a, img is a simple command which allows you to display images (img 
src="image link"/, the a command allows you to add links to certain words us a href="website link" word a/ for example <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ak5m3bo90zA/maxresdefault.jpg"> Linked word <a/>


<!-- REMEMBER, EACH PARAGRAPH DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS IT LOOKS --!>
<!-- THE FONT,COLOR AND PX SIZES DO NOT WORK ON GITHUB, DON'T USE IT --!>

<h1> What is CSS? </h1>
<p> CSS or Cascade Style Sheets (or Counter Strike Source as I call it) is the styling part of HTML. CSS has a very simple purpose and once you talk about HTML commands, theres nothing to really talk about CSS, The only thing you can really say about CSS is that it alters the look of a website. </p>

<h1> Why is code Important </h1>
<p> With the direction society is heading in, AKA the technological direction, Code will be used for a lot more things than it is now.
Code can also be used to programs new machines that can be sold for a lot of money. The more technology people make the more types of code there that can be taught allowing more inventions to be created and newer code to be used and so on.</p>
<h1> The end of my presentation </h1>
<p> We've reached the end of my presentation, this is almost all I know about HTML and other code I've used, If you want to know more, Learn to code at various sites, Scratch, Code.org and CodeAcademy.
After I show you this meme, I will show you the all the lines of code used in this presentation.</p>
